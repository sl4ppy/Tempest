# Tempest Arcade Game Recreation

## Project Status (January 9, 2025)

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED SYSTEMS**
- **Core Engine**: ECS, event system, memory management: **Complete**
- **Player System**: Movement, tube geometry, collision: **Complete**
- **Enemy System**: All 5 enemy types (Flipper, Pulsar, Tanker, Spiker, Fuzzball): **Complete**
- **Weapons & Combat**: Zap, Fire, Super Zapper, projectile system: **Complete**
- **Rendering Infrastructure**: OpenGL 3.3+ vector graphics pipeline: **Complete**
- **Graphics API**: OpenGL/Vulkan initialization and context management: **Complete**
- **VectorCommand System**: Based on original vsdraw commands with batching: **Complete**
- **Tube Geometry**: 3D tube rendering with 16-segment perspective: **Complete**
- **Shader System**: Shader compilation and built-in Tempest shaders: **Complete**
- **Camera & Viewport**: 3D perspective rendering management: **Complete**
- **TempestShapes**: Authentic shape generation from 1981 assembly code: **Complete**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CURRENT ISSUES**
- **Shape Rendering**: Despite implementing exact vector data from original 1981 Tempest assembly, none of the ships or enemies render correctly
- **Visual Authenticity**: Player ship should be WHITE, Spiker should be MAGENTA with proper animation, but shapes don't display as expected
- **Performance**: System runs at 85-89 FPS processing 49 commands, but visual output is incorrect

### üî® **NEXT PRIORITIES**
1. **Fix Shape Rendering**: Debug why authentic vector data isn't displaying correctly
2. **Color Correction**: Ensure proper color mapping from original arcade palette
3. **Vector Command Processing**: Verify VectorCommand system is properly translating to OpenGL
4. **Shape Validation**: Test individual shapes to isolate rendering issues

## Overview
This project is a faithful recreation of the original 1981 Tempest arcade game using the exact vector data from the original assembly code. The project features a complete rendering infrastructure with modern OpenGL while maintaining authenticity to the original arcade experience.

## Architecture
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Efficient game object management
- **Modern OpenGL Pipeline**: Vector graphics rendering with command batching
- **Authentic Vector Data**: Shapes extracted from original 1981 assembly code
- **Performance Optimized**: 85-89 FPS with efficient command processing

## Technical Implementation
- **Language**: C++20 with modern features
- **Graphics**: OpenGL 3.3+ with vector graphics pipeline
- **Vector Commands**: Based on original vsdraw command system
- **Authentic Shapes**: Exact vector data from Tempest.asm and Tempest_alt.asm
- **Performance**: Real-time rendering with command batching optimization

## Current System Status
- **Rendering Pipeline**: ‚úÖ Functional OpenGL 3.3+ with SDL
- **VectorCommand System**: ‚úÖ Complete with all command types
- **Shape Generation**: ‚úÖ Authentic data from 1981 assembly
- **Performance**: ‚úÖ 85-89 FPS with 49 commands per frame
- **Visual Output**: ‚ùå Shapes not rendering correctly despite authentic data

## How to Build and Run

1. **Prerequisites**
   - C++20 compatible compiler
   - CMake 3.20+
   - OpenGL 3.3+ compatible GPU
   - SDL2 development libraries

2. **Build Instructions**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/tempest-rebuild.git
   cd tempest-rebuild
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. **Running the Game**
   ```bash
   cd bin/Release
   ./TempestRebuild
   ```

## Development Notes
- All shapes use exact vector coordinates from original 1981 assembly
- Player ship uses WHITE color (c=1) as in original
- Spiker enemy uses MAGENTA color (c=5) with 4-frame animation
- VectorCommand system processes authentic vsdraw sequences
- Performance metrics show stable 85-89 FPS operation

## Known Issues
- **Shape Rendering**: Visual output doesn't match expected authentic shapes
- **Color Mapping**: Colors may not be mapping correctly from original palette
- **Vector Translation**: VectorCommand to OpenGL translation needs debugging

## Contributing
The project is currently focused on resolving the shape rendering authenticity issues. All vector data is verified against the original 1981 assembly code, so the issue is likely in the rendering pipeline translation.
