# Tempest Rebuild Project

## Overview

This project aims to rebuild the classic arcade game **Tempest** (Atari, 1981) using modern hardware and development techniques while preserving the original gameplay mechanics and visual style.

## Project Goals

- **Faithful Recreation**: Maintain the original game's core mechanics, physics, and visual style
- **Modern Architecture**: Use contemporary programming languages, frameworks, and best practices
- **Cross-Platform**: Support Windows, macOS, Linux, and web browsers
- **Extensibility**: Design for easy modification, modding, and future enhancements
- **Performance**: Optimize for modern hardware while maintaining authentic gameplay feel
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for developers and players
