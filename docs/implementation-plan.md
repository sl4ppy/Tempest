    uint8_t timectr;          // Time counter
    uint8_t player_control;   // Player input mode
    uint8_t credits;          // Game credits
    uint8_t zap_fire_shadow;  // Control shadow
    // ... additional fields
};

// Input System (RAM 004C-0051)
struct InputState {
    uint8_t zap_fire_tmp1;    // Current button state
    uint8_t zap_fire_debounce; // Debounced buttons
    uint8_t zap_fire_new;     // New button presses
    uint8_t spinner_change;   // Spinner movement
    uint8_t player_position;  // Player position
};

// Enemy System (RAM 0108-0146)
struct EnemyState {
    uint8_t enemies_in;       // Enemies inside tube
    uint8_t enemies_top;      // Enemies at top
    uint8_t ply_shotcnt;      // Active player shots
    uint8_t cur_enemies[5];   // Current enemy counts
