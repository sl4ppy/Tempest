**Enemy Types**:
- **Flippers**: Move along segments, can grab player
- **Pulsars**: Stationary, fire projectiles
- **Tankers**: Heavy, slow-moving, can carry other enemies
- **Spikers**: Grow spikes on tube segments
- **Fuzzballs**: Fast, erratic movement patterns

**Game States**:
- Multiple game states (menu, playing, pause, high score, etc.)
- Level progression with increasing difficulty
- High score system with persistent storage
- Attract mode with demo gameplay

### Modern Enhancements
1. **Enhanced Graphics**: Anti-aliasing, particle effects, post-processing
2. **Improved Audio**: Spatial audio, dynamic mixing, enhanced synthesis
3. **Accessibility**: Color blind support, customizable controls, difficulty options
4. **Modern Input**: Gamepad support, customizable key bindings, touch input
5. **Performance**: 60 FPS target, optimized rendering, efficient memory usage
